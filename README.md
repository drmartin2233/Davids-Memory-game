Technologies used: JavaScript, HTML, CSS

Getting Started: 

This is a classic memory matching game. This version relies on matching colored "cards" on the board, with 8 possible color matches. You begin by clicking the 'start' button, which begins a timer. You are playing against the clock, trying to match all cards before the 1 minute time runs out. When the timer runs out, if you have not found all the matches, you lose the game. You win the game as long as you find all matches before the timer runs out, but it is also fun to see how fast you can go once you have mastered beating the clock. When the match is over you can reset the board by clicking the 'replay' button, which also shuffles the cards for you, so it's a new challenge each time. Just hit 'start' to play again!
